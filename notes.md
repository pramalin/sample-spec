/speckit.plan The application has three tiers, 1 frontend, 2 backend and database. The frontend uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible. The backend is written in Java 25 / Spring Boot 4 using functional programming style as much as possible guided by Scala 3 projects, ie. use Algebraic Data Type for the domain objects, pure functions, etc. The database is postgres. Setup docker image for all the tiers and create docker compose command to bring up the application to run it locally.
